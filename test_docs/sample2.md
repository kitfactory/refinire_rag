# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning  
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Applications: game playing, robotics, autonomous systems

## Popular Libraries
- **scikit-learn**: General-purpose ML library
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework
- **PyTorch**: Research-focused deep learning
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
