Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with environment

Applications:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Predictive Analytics
